# Website Traffic Analysis 📈

## Description
This project provides an analysis of website traffic over time, using a dataset with daily visit counts. By exploring visit trends, seasonality, and peak activity periods, this project aims to offer insights into user engagement and identify potential factors impacting web traffic.

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the raw website traffic dataset (`Date` and `Visits`).
- **Analysis**: Scripts for data cleaning, trend analysis, and visualization.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs generated from the analysis to illustrate traffic trends and patterns.

---

## 📈 Key Features
- **Traffic Trends**: Analyze how website visits change over time, identifying upward or downward trends.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Determine whether traffic has seasonal trends (e.g., day of the week, month, or time of year).
- **Anomalies**: Detect any significant spikes or drops in traffic that may indicate special events or issues.
